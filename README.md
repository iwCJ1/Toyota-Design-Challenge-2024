How to use Branches:
- Go into command line
- Make a new branch using "git branch [insert new branch name]"
- Switch to the newly made branch using "git checkout [insert new branch name]"
- Do all your coding stuff
- Use "git add ." to stage (aka prepare) all your changes
- Use "git commit -m [insert commit message]" to commit (aka save) your changes
- Use "git push" to push your changes to the remote github (if command line gives you a better command using something something "upstream" something something then copy and use that)
- Once in github, make a pull request to merge your changes in the original main branch (will elaborate later)
- Note:
    - When starting work after someone else has made a merge, use "git pull" IN YOUR OWN NEW BRANCH to bring the changes to your own branch.
